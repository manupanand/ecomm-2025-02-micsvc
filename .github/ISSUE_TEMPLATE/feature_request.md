## Feature Description
**As a** product owner,  
**I need** functionality to use Redis Streams as the backend database,  
**So that** the application can handle fast processing and high-throughput data streams efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria
- **Given** the application is configured with Redis,  
- **When** Redis Streams are implemented,  
- **Then** the system should support event-driven data processing with low latency.

## Additional Context
- Discuss any alternatives considered or reasons for choosing Redis Streams.
- Mention the specific problem this feature will solve or how it improves the system.

## Tasks
- [ ] Set up Redis Streams in the development environment.
- [ ] Update the backend to use Redis Streams for event storage.
- [ ] Write tests for Redis Streams functionality.
